00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:04,000
- Welcome to this demo presented by Datahop

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,000
- We will address the device on the left as device A and the other one as Device B

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,383
We are adding dummy content in A

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,383
After content addition A starts advertising, it has some content

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,383
B discovers A and starts wifi hotspot 

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,383
A connects to the hotspot

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,383
Both of them gets connected and B starts getting data from A

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,383
At this point data transfer is completed

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,383
They get disconnected as they now have common data

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,383
Thank you
