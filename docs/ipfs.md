The outcome of this DataHop is local content sharing in mobile devices without requiring any network infrastructure. IPFS platform provides required networking features that will substitute typical client-server architecture for end-user centric networking. These features are:

* Content addressing: IPFS provides a content identifier, or CID used to point to material in IPFS. This can be used to identify and fetch content without requiring defining a specific content naming for a specific application.
* Content storage: IPFS provides a local storage cache that stores any file provided or fetched by the user. This is used to enable content sharing from any user that previously got the same content without requiring a centralised model
* Peer-to-peer connectivity: An important part of the IPFS project is the libp2p subproject. Libp2p provides all required network libraries to start connections with other users, discovery features and write/read data from other peers.
* Infrastructure integration: This feature allows users to discover and fetch content from remote peers when infrastructure is available (Internet connectivity) to later make it available to local users.

To this end DataHop based it smartphone service on IPFS, develovping an embeddable and lightweight IPFS peer that can run on Android devices. This fork started from [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite). It offers all the features of main [ipfs-lite](https://github.com/hsanjuan/ipfs-lite). For certain requirements of
DataHop it adds some more features of full IPFS, such as config, repo, leveldb etc.

## Examples

### cli client
```
 go run ./examples/litepeer/litepeer.go
```

### mobile client
```
  go run ./examples/mobilepeer/mobilepeer.go
```

## Objectives

* [x] create cache repo as IPFS
* [x] have persistent config information (Id, keys, ports, bootstraps etc)
* [x] use leveldb as datastore to set up peer
* [x] generate gomobile binding for android
* [x] adding content
* [x] replicating content
* [x] remove content
* [x] remove respective replication info for removed content
* [x] bootstrap mobile client
* [x] cli for bootstrap peer
